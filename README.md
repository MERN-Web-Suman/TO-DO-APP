# To-Do-App

A To-Do App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to manage daily tasks effectively. HTML provides the basic structure, including an input field, add button, and task list. CSS styles the layout, improving user experience with spacing, fonts, and colors. JavaScript brings interactivity by enabling task addition, removal, and completion toggling. When a user adds a task, it appears in a list below. Clicking on a task marks it as complete. The app can be further enhanced using local storage to save tasks across sessions. This simple project demonstrates core front-end development skills in a practical application.
